# Contrast Grid (APCA Version, not fully implemented yet!!! Stay tuned!!)

Test many foreground and background color combos for compliance with [APCA guidelines](https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA)

This is a fork from a nifty contrast display method. The original uses the WCAG 2 method, here, we are going to integrate the perceptually uniform ACPA method, replacing the non-perceptual WCAG 2 contrast math.

WORK IN PROGRESS STAY TUNED
